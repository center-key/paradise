Valums File Uploader (Ajax Upload)
----------------------------------
1) Download from:
     http://valums.com/ajax-upload/
2) Copy the following files from "valums-file-uploader" into the PPAGES
project:
     client/fileuploader.css --> ppages/console/fileuploader.css
     client/fileuploader.js  --> ppages/console/fileuploader.js
     client/loading.gif      --> ppages/console/loading.gif
     server/php.php          --> ppages/console/fileuploader.php
3) In "fileuploader.php", change "uploads/" to "../data/uploads/"
... and also comment out: $this->checkServerSettings();  (it seems to cause errors)
4) In "fileuploader.js", change "Upload a file" to "Upload Photos"
